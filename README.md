  Given a functioning frontend, this exercise was a build-out of the backend. Models and Routes were constructed to facilitate editing and display of the front end e-commerce website. It was not deployed as this isan exercize in backend development.

Update the environment variable file (.env) file if needed. To start the server run npm start, then seed the database by running npm run seed.  I used MySql workbench to view my models (tables) in the ecommerce_db, and Insomnia to test the routes.
